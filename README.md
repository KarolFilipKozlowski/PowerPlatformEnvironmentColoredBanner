# Power-Platform-Environment-Colored-Banner
**Power Platform Environment Colored Banner** is a browser extension designed for Microsoft Power Platform users, particularly those working with Power Apps, that helps identify the current environment (e.g., Production, Sandbox, Developer) by displaying a customizable banner on the page. This tool minimizes errors by ensuring you know exactly where you’re working.

## Why Use This Extension?
When working across multiple environments (production, sandbox, testing, etc.), it’s easy to lose track and accidentally perform actions in the wrong environment. Power Platform Environment Colored Banner addresses this issue by displaying a colored banner at the top of the page, indicating the type of environment and optional description. At a glance, you know where you are, helping prevent unwanted modifications.

## How to Use This Extension?
After installing the extension, click on its icon. Then, on the newly opened settings page, fill out the form by entering the environment ID (GUID). You can find this ID directly in the URL. Next, choose a background color and environment type, and optionally, add a description. Once the environment is added, it will appear in the list below the form. You can update the environment’s settings at any time by adding it again with the same ID (the extension will overwrite the existing entry if the ID is already on the list). You can also delete any added entry whenever needed.
